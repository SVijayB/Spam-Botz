## Motivation

This application was built to well, spam. 

There is no real motivation behind building a spam bot but to simply annoy people.<br>
Or at times even crash the application. 

This application allows you to spam in variations, like : 
- Spamming a fixed static message.
- Spamming random words from a dictionary.
- Sending sequences of numbers.
- Randomly spamming large numbers.
- Good old Rage spam, but this time without breaking your keyboard.

## Usage

For the latest Stable version, go to <a href="https://github.com/SVijayB/Spam-Botz/releases">Releases</a>

Extract the files and run `main.py` file present in the `src` folder.

As an alternative, you could also clone the repository using.
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/SVijayB/Spam-Botz.git
</pre>

**NOTE :** It is best to open your messaging window before launching `main.py`.

**NOTE :** Make sure your cursor is pointing to the correct text box after you set your preferences.
You have only **15 Seconds** before the automation process begins.
